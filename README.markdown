## Scala Textmate Bundle ##
This is my scala bundle for textmate. It contains a pretty good grammer for 
syntax highlighting and some useful snippets.  There is also a command for 
aligning assignments, match arrows `=>` and single arrows `->`.

I used [this](https://github.com/mads379/scala.tmbundle) bundle as a starting point.
